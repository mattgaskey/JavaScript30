    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); //age2 does not update


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    team[1] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    console.log(players, team); //it's not a copy!

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Matt';
    console.log(team, team2);
    // one way
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4.length = 0;
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
    	name: 'Matt',
    	age: 34
    };
    // and think we make a copy:

    // const person1 = person;
    // person1.age = 44;
    // console.log(person, person1);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 44});
    console.log(person, person2);

    // We also have the object ...spread

    const person3 = {...person};
    person3.age = 99;
    console.log(person, person3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const matt = {
    	name: 'Matt',
    	age: 34,
    	social: {
    		github: 'mattgaskey',
    		facebook: 'gattmaskey'
    	}
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(matt);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, matt);
